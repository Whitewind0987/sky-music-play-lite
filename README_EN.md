## 丨Experimental Input

SkyMusicPlay Lite includes experimental input features.

Experimental features are disabled by default and must be enabled manually in Settings.  
Please understand and follow the rules of the related game or software before using them.

Current experimental input modes include:

- **Foreground Input Mode**: sends simulated keyboard input to the current foreground window.
- **Target Window Message Mode**: sends keyboard messages to the selected target window handle.

These features are still experimental and are not guaranteed to work on every system, permission level, window state, or game environment.
